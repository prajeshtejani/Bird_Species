# Bird Species Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks
This project aims to classify bird species using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) implemented with TensorFlow and Keras. It utilizes a dataset containing images of various bird species.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "Bird Species Dataset," which contains images of different bird species. The dataset is structured into folders, each representing a different bird species, and contains images of the respective species.

# Requirements
To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib
OpenCV
scikit-learn

You can install the dependencies using pip:
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib opencv-python scikit-learn

# Usage
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/prajeshtejani/Bird_Species.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd Bird_Species

- Download the "Bird Species Dataset" and extract it into the project directory.

- Open the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script.

- Run the script or notebook to train the CNN model.

- Once trained, the model will be tested on the test set, and accuracy metrics will be displayed.

- You can also use the trained model for inference by providing your own images of bird species.

# Results
After training the CNN model, it achieved an accuracy of approximately 85.89% on the test set.

# Sample Prediction
Below is an example of a prediction made by the trained model:

Original Label: BARN OWL
Predicted Label: BARN OWL
